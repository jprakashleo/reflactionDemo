# reflactionDemo

Reflaction is .net feature provided to access all members and property of any assembly without opening the source code.
To use this feature you need to import System.Reflection namespace in project.
Here I have created a CustomPrint class under PrintAll namespace.
When program execution starts in program.cs, it write the all public/private/static members/properties on the console.
There are many live example of Feature, gess !
